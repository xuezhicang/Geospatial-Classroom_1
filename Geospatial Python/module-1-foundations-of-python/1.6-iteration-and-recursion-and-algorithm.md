# 1.6 Iteration and recursion, and Algorithm



## Iteration



```
// Some code

for variable in sequence:



while condition == True
```



## Recursion



* Recursion (will revisit it later)

```
// Some code
def factorial(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    return n * factorial(n - 1)

print(factorial(5))


```



Many people use it, but we should avoid it.<br>

## Comparsion

#### Disadvantages of Recursion

1.  High Memory Usage


2.  Risk of Stack Overflow


3.  Slower Performance (think about it)


4.  Less Intuitive for Beginners


5.  Limited by Language Stack Size (especially in Python)





## Algorithm



### Sort algorithm <br>
