## Difference between **remote sensing, GIS, GPS**

## Passive vs active remote sensing (conceptual)

Advantages: large area coverage, repeat observations

Limitations: atmospheric effects, resolution constraints

## Major application areas:

Land use / land cover

Agriculture & vegetation monitoring

Urban growth

Disaster management

Climate & environmental change

## Examples students recognize

Google Earth

weather satellites
